# Vector-Borne-Disease-Prediction

Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a project on predicting vector-borne diseases using machine learning. Vector-borne diseases are illnesses caused by pathogens that are transmitted to humans through vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify the likely prognosis of patients based on associated symptoms, specifically for 11 vector-borne diseases.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided in two files:

train.csv: The training dataset, which includes the prognosis as the target variable.

test.csv: The test dataset, for which the objective is to predict the prognosis.

The data was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Vector Borne Disease Prediction dataset. Feature distributions in these datasets are similar but not identical to the original dataset. Participants are encouraged to explore the differences and assess whether incorporating the original dataset into training can improve model performance.

Diseases Included

The project focuses on predicting the prognosis for the following 11 vector-borne diseases:

Chikungunya

Dengue

Zika

Yellow Fever

Rift Valley Fever

West Nile Fever

Malaria

Tungiasis

Japanese Encephalitis

Plague
